# kata-playground
This is a project setup to quickly get started with various Coding Katas using JUnit and Java 8.

Currently the following Katas are included:
- String Calculator
- Prime Factors
- Conway's Game of Life
- Bowling Game
- Word Chains

A description with requirements for each Kata is included in each test class (see its JavaDoc).

Remember the TDD and Kata rules:
- Do one task at a time. 
- Do it incrementally. 
- Solve requirements as simple as possible.
- Refactor after each successful test.
- This is about learning TDD/BDD *"red, green, repeat"*
