# kata-playground
This is a project setup to quickly get started with various Coding Katas using Cucumber, JUnit and Java 8.

Currently the following Katas are included:
* [String Calculator] (Kata-StringCalculator) (thanks to [Roy Osherove](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/))
* [Prime Factors] (Kata-PrimeFactors) (thanks to _Uncle Bob_ [Robert C. Martin] (http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata))

(see [Wiki] (Home) for more details)

Remember the TDD and Kata rules:
- Do one task at a time. 
- Do it incrementally. 
- Solve requirements as simple as possible.
- Refactor after each successful test.
- This is about learning TDD/BDD *"red, green, repeat"*
