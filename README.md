# kata-playground
This is a project setup to quickly get started with various Coding Katas using JUnit and Java 8.

Currently the following Katas are included:

* Bowling Game (thanks to _Uncle Bob_ [Robert C. Martin's Bowling Game Kata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata))
* Conway's Game of Life (thanks to Mr. Conway)
* Prime Factors (thanks to _Uncle Bob_ [Robert C. Martin's Prime Factor Kata] (http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata))
* Roman Number Converter
* String Calculator (thanks to [Roy Osherove](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/))
* Word Chains (thanks to [Dave Thomas] (http://codekata.com/kata/kata19-word-chains/))

A description with requirements for each Kata is included in each test class (see its JavaDoc).

Remember the TDD and Kata rules:
- Do one task at a time. 
- Do it incrementally. 
- Solve requirements as simple as possible.
- Refactor after each successful test.
- This is about learning TDD/BDD *"red, green, repeat"*
