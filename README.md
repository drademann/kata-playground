# kata-playground
This is a project setup to quickly get started with various Coding Katas using Cucumber, JUnit and Java 8.

Currently the following Katas are included:
- String Calculator
- Prime Factors

(see [Wiki] (https://github.com/drademann/kata-playground/wiki) for more details)

Remember the TDD and Kata rules:
- Do one task at a time. 
- Do it incrementally. 
- Solve requirements as simple as possible.
- Refactor after each successful test.
- This is about learning TDD/BDD *"red, green, repeat"*
