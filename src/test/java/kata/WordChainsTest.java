/**
 * <strong>Requirements</strong>
 *
 * <p>This feature tries to find a way to get from one word to another by changing only one letter per step.
 * The length of the word doesn't change and the word must be a valid and known english word and not some
 * fantasy creation.</p>
 *
 * <p>In example you can get from cat to dog this way:</p>
 *
 * <p>cat - cot - cog - dog</p>
 *
 * <p><i>ps.</i> find a long list of words in {@code src/test/java/resources}</p>
